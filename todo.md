Create a report mechanism that outputs a docx report. This report is to be a comprehensive and detailed report designed to be sent to a client that describes the following:

- Current environment
- Analysis of current environment
- Migration options
- Migration costs
- Describes ROKS
- Describes VPC VSI

The docx consumes pre-drafted text which is easily accessible so can be updated as needed, say a template, that then gets used to insert dynamic info on a per report basis.

The report is to be very professional as it represents a proposal to the client.
